Two individuals are in custody after eleven secondary school students were injured in a firearms incident near a school Auchinleck Academy, in East Ayrshire, Scotland, yesterday afternoon. Police have said they are carrying out "extensive enquiries" into the incident, which reportedly involved an air gun or BB gun.
One pupil said he was walking near the school during the lunch hour and "saw two people behind a hedge." There was a sound "like a small explosion," he said. "I wasn't really frightened at first but I'm quite shaken now as I know what damage has been done."
Strathclyde Police said officers were attending an incident near the secondary school, which has approximately 950 students. Chief Superintendent John Thompson, who is leading the police inquiry into the incident, confirmed two people, aged 15 and 18, were detained in the area of the incident, in which eleven youths were injured.
"Subsequent inquiries directed us towards a house in Auchinleck where we have detained an 18-year-old male and a 15-year-old male," Thompson said. "Both of those individuals are being interviewed at present and our inquiries are ongoing." He appealed for people in the area of the incident to contact police.
East Ayrshire council stated "[t]he school responded immediately, informing the police and parents of the children involved, and sought appropriate medical attention", and added officials were supporting pupils. Auchinleck Academy has not replied to a request for a comment from Wikinews.
