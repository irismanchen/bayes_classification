Former science director sues Texas over intelligent design e-mail

Thursday, July 3, 2008 
Christine Comer, former director of the science curriculum for the Texas Education Agency (TEA), is suing the Commissioner Robert Scott for wrongful dismissal. Comer alleges that she was "illegally fired for forwarding an e-mail about a lecture that was critical of the teaching of intelligent design in science classes." Her suit alleges she was "terminated for contravening an unconstitutional policy" which required "employees to be neutral on the subject of creationism – the biblical interpretation of the origin of humans."
The Dallas Morning News reported, "The policy was in force even though the federal courts have ruled that teaching creationism as science in public schools is illegal under U.S. Constitution's provision preventing government establishment or endorsement of religious beliefs." Among Comer's supporters is Philosopher and National Center for Science Education speaker Barbara Forrest who was the presenter at the lecture Comer mentioned in the email.
News 8 Austin reported, "The TEA was not available for comment late Wednesday."
