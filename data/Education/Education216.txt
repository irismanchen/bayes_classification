Wikinews:Instructor rights request

Refresh
This page is for instructors to request instructor rights to use the Education Course Extension on Wikinews. To file a request for instructor rights, please first complete the training at WN:EDU and read relevant site policies. You can also view the instructors users list. Once done, click on the button and fill out all relevant fields. After the community has read your application and approved it, permissions will be given and will be notified of the change you may start work on developing course materials. If you desire, you may also request a @wikinewsie.org e-mail address by contacting Brian McNeil.
