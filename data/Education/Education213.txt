Read Santa Clara marks tenth anniversary

Saturday, September 10, 2005 
Santa Clara, California, USA. The adult literacy program Read Santa Clara marked its tenth anniversary today with a gathering of program participants, staff, and supporters from the community. Read Santa Clara trains volunteer tutors and matches them with adult learners who wish to build their literacy skills.
In the presentation, program staff and supporters reviewed the program's history and growth, honored long-time participants, and looked toward the future.
Santa Clara Mayor Patricia Mahan spoke at the gathering, noting, "Read Santa Clara joins people who need to learn with people who need to teach, and what a powerful combination that is." She added, "I think adult literacy is so important."
Program coordinators estimate that tutors volunteered some 5000 hours last year. City Manager Jennifer Sparacino estimates, "That's worth about $100,000 per year in volunteer time."
Learners also spoke about what Read Santa Clara meant to them. Raymond Moreno said, "I hope it stays for another ten, twenty, thirty years, because we need it." Juan Velasquez said, "My life has changed a lot...I did many things I could not have done without help." And Ike Moore said, "To be able to express myself...What a gift!"
