Fall sweeps through Texas

Friday, October 7, 2005 
Walking outside this morning, the average seasoned Texan will notice something amiss — the eerie quiet. The droning of air conditioners and insects has stopped, replaced with the scent of hardwood smoke and a slight shiver.
A pocket of Arctic air finally pushed through well into the Gulf of Mexico, plunging temperatures across the state into the 50s and 60s. While the chilliest lows are not expected to stay for more than a few days, forecasters are expecting Texas' normal fall pattern of a cooler front about every week to continue. Average weekly temperatures should reach steadily lower as the season progresses.
Stormy Weather
As an added bonus to many, rain trickled down onto San Antonio and many other Texas cities. This rain has relieved areas which have been dry for months.
