Flooding ravages Northeastern United States

Tuesday, May 16, 2006Â 
The New England region of the United States has received the heaviest rainfall in decades leading to flooding and massive road closures. The states affected are Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. A state of emergency has been declared in all these areas. The floods have also led to thousands of evacuations in many cities. Only a single death has been reported.
The main concern in many cities and towns is whether the dams that hold rivers from flowing in cities will hold long enough.
These floods are the worst in New England since 1936 when over 150 died.
