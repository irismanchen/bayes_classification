Saturday, May 5, 2007Â 
At least nine people were killed and another 60 were injured after a tornado swept through the town of Greensburg, Kansas in the United States.
The tornado, which meteorologists described as a 1.4 mile wide wedge tornado, came through at approximately 9:38 p.m. local time. It leveled about 95% of the town, including at least two schools and the town's hospital. The entire population of the town, around 1,500 people, has been evacuated.
One of the few structures currently left standing, a tavern, has been turned into a makeshift morgue. Residents are currently being bussed to nearby hospitals or storm shelters for the night.
More tornadoes can be expected Saturday; Greensburg is in the area which the Storm Prediction Center has listed as a high risk for tornadoes, something that is rarely done.
