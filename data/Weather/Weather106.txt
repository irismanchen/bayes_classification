A fourteen-year-old boy has gone missing yesterday, after being swept up in waves at Newhaven, East Sussex. The boy was one of many teenagers seen playing in the waves about 10 meters (11 yards) off the Newhaven coast shortly before the emergency messages were raised. Sussex Police received a call at 4:15 PM GMT that the boy was caught up in the current while swimming off West Beach and rescue services have been so far unsuccessful finding his body.
A five-hour rescue search was abandoned at 9:45 PM yesterday after one of the search personnel was injured in the severe weather conditions. All search teams were stood down for the night. Nearby roads have been closed down to prepare residents for the worst.
Sussex Police have released a statement saying, "This is a very distressing incident and everything possible is being done to try and find the boy”.
Heavy rain, flooding and hurricane gusts up to 130km/h (80.8 mph) were expected to worsen throughout the UK today and continue until 9:00 AM GMT.
