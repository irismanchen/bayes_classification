Hurricane Earl threatens eastern US

Thursday, September 2, 2010Â 
Hurricane Earl, a large tropical cyclone in the Atlantic ocean, is currently on course to strike parts of the eastern United States, including the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The storm began near the Cape Verde islands off the coast of Africa, and moved steadily to the west. It then neared the Caribbean, and caused damage in Puerto Rico and the Anguilla before taking a more northwards track. As of now, Earl continues on a northward track, but is expected to turn to the east.
As hurricanes generally are difficult to predict and have vastly changing forecasts sometimes, Wikinews will be providing with readers with live updates on Hurricane Earl. If you are in the path of this storm, remember to follow all updates and evacuation orders by local and federal governments.
