First snowfall of the season impacts the Northeast US

Sunday, December 6, 2009Â 

Forecasters say the storm is related to the same system that brought record-breaking snowfall to the Houston, Texas region a few days ago.
Most locations will pick up a few inches of snow when all is said and done, enough to cause widespread travel delays and traffic accidents throughout the area. Accordingly, the National Weather Service has issued several winter weather warnings stretching from the South through Maine. Environment Canada has issued a snowfall warning for Atlantic Canada and is expecting 15 to 30 centimeters of snow.
By midday Sunday, the storm will have pulled out of the region, leaving behind clearing skies.
Meanwhile, a winter storm hit southern Alberta, Canada on Friday causing blizzard like conditions and dumping over 20 centimeters of snow.
