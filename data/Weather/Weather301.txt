Record snowfall in Japan: in pictures

Tuesday, March 5, 2013Â 
Snow has accumulated to record depths, in excess of five metres, in the Hakkoda mountain range of Aomori Prefecture in Northern Japan. More snow fell in northern Japan over the weekend, and at least eight people died as people become trapped in their cars and buried underneath the heavy snow. A bullet train travelling from Tokyo to northern Japan also derailed, however no one was injured.
Wikimedians provided pictures of the snow for Wikinews.
