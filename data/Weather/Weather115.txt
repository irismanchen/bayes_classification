A tornado tore through much of the town of Van, Texas late Sunday evening. Officials said over 40 people were transported to local hospitals for treatment and reportedly two people died during the storm — David Tapley, a retired Garland, Texas police officer, and his wife.
The National Weather Service estimated winds over 130 miles per hour (210 kilometres per hour) during the tornado. Late Monday afternoon, debris was still scattered over much of the central portion of the town. An historic building which served as the town's first school suffered significant damage. Other school buildings were also damaged. All classes for students were cancelled for Monday.
Work crews and numerous utility trucks were on site Monday and the city's main street remained closed to thru traffic. A residential area on the town's eastern side was littered with debris and downed trees could be seen along the streets. Fifteen fire departments across five Texas counties responded following the storm, according to the county fire marshal.
