Bayern Munich's win over MSV Duisburg condemned Duisburg to second division football next term.
Bayern Munich took a 3-0 lead after 20 minutes, an Andreas Ottl goal along with quick-fire Lukas Podolski brace ensuring the champions had a comfortable ride through to half time.
However, the match took a sudden and dramatic twist in the ten minutes following the restart as Mihai Tararache and Markus Daun scored to hauled the Duisburg right back into the game, and an upset briefly appeared a possibility. However, Bayern Munich would go onto a comfortable win.
