Pakistan defeated Australia by six wickets in the Super 8 stage of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 at Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, South Africa.
Australia lost early wickets, with Matthew Hayden caught on one run in the first over. Adam Gilchrist made 24 before being removed in the fourth over. Andrew Symonds and Ricky Ponting added a 48 run partnership but Shahid Afridi bowled Symonds for 29 runs and Mohammad Hafeez bowled Ponting, who made 27. Michael Hussey (37) and Brad Hodge (36) shared 63 runs to help Australia to 164-7, while Sohail Tanvir took 3-31 for Pakistan.
In response Pakistan were reduced to 46-4 in the seventh over as Australia's bowlers made breakthroughs. Stuart Clark took three wickets, dismissing Imran Nazir, Mohammad Hafeez and Younis Khan cheaply, while Salman Butt fell lbw to Mitchell Johnson. However Shoaib Malik (52 not out) and Misbah-ul-Haq (66 not out) claimed victory and a likely semi-final place for Pakistan.
