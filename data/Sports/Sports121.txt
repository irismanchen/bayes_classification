Saturday, September 15, 2007Â 
South Africa have beaten Bangladesh by seven wickets in Group A of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 at Newlands Cricket Ground, Cape Town, South Africa.
Bangladesh started their innings quickly, and had reached fifty runs by the start of the fourth over. However they had also lost three wickets, as Nazimuddin fell lbw to Makhaya Ntini's first delivery. Both Tamim Iqbal and Mohammad Ashraful, who scored ten runs off three balls, were caught by Graeme Smith. Aftab Ahmed was bowled by Morne Morkel after hitting 36 runs off 14 balls. Shakib Al Hasan only made 19 before being run out, and Bangladesh were restricted to 144 all out by some effective South African fielding.
South Africa comfortably reached the target with seven balls remaining, and had made 65 runs before Abdur Razzak trapped Jean-Paul Duminy lbw for 36. Graeme Smith was caught behind on 41, and Albie Morkel had also made 41 runs when he was caught at long-off.
