Wednesday, September 19, 2007Â 
India have defeated England by 18 runs in the Super 8 stage of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 at Kingsmead, Durban, South Africa. The man of the match, Yuvraj Singh, scored six sixes in one over off of Stuart Broad.
Yuvraj Singh hit the fast 50 in international cricket as India posted an imposing total of 218 runs. He smashed 58 off 16 balls, reaching 50 in just 12, having hit Stuart Broad for six sixes in one over. Gautam Gambhir made 58, while Virender Sehwag scored 68. England's bowlers failed to make a breakthrough before the fifteenth over, when Sehwag was bowled by Chris Tremlett. Gambhir was dismissed in the next over, followed by Tremlett claiming his second wicket when he bowled Robin Uthappa for six runs
England, who had already been eliminated from the tournament, started solidly. Kevin Pietersen scored 39 and Vikram Solanki made 43, but the required run rate was too high and wickets fell regularly, with Irfan Pathan taking 3-37 and Rudra Pratap Singh taking two wickets in one over, and England finished 18 runs short on 200-6.
