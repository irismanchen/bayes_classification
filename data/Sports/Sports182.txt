British football clubs Manchester United and Chelsea today competed in the first ever Champions League final containing only English clubs. The UEFA Champions League is a large European football tournament, where the highest ranked teams from many countries compete. Manchester United won 6-5 on penalties.
The match started off slowly, with the first goal being scored by Cristiano Ronaldo for Manchester United. The goal was scored at 19:11 UTC.
Claude Makelele and Paul Scholes were both given yellow cards in the 22nd minute due to a collision in air which resulted in Scholes receiving treatment for a small injury.
A goal scored just before half time, by Frank Lampard, put both sides at an equal position for the start of the second half. The goal was scored from a free kick which was taken as a result of a foul by Rio Ferdinand in the 44th minute. Ferdinand got a yellow card as a result of the incident.
In the first few minutes of the second half, Manchester United were awarded a free kick due to a foul by Ballack, which resulted Ronaldo falling to the ground.
At the mid point in the second half a BBC commentator predicted that changes would be made to the Manchester squad. "Fergie [Alex Ferguson, Manchester United manager] remains impassive on the United bench, but surely he can't leave it too much longer before making a change? His team are being over-powered at present," he said.
Drogba aimed to give Chelsea a lead with a shot in the 79th minute, which hit the left hand post.
A late substitution resulted in Paul Scholes being taken off and Ryan Giggs being brought on for Manchester United,
