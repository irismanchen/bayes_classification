Ghana dominated the match from the beginning but had to wait till stoppage time in the first half before scoring their first goal. Sadick Adams collected a pass from Ransford Osei, but saw his initial shot blocked by Eder Hermoza, the Peru goalkeeper. He however managed to score from the rebound.
The second half continued as the first with Ghana ending up with 55% of the total ball possession and with 12 shots on target compared to 1 shot on target for Peru. In the 53rd minute, an overhead kick by Issac Donkor hit the upright before Osei slotted it home to guarantee victory. This goal makes Osei joint top scorer of the tournament so far on 5 goals.
Ghana are scheduled to meet Spain in the semi-final on Wednesday September 5, 2007.
