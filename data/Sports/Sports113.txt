Paul Collingwood fell lbw to Brett Lee for 18 while Andrew Flintoff was caught by Stuart Clark on 31, leaving England on 127-6. England collapsed to 135 all out at the end of their 20 overs, after losing their last four wickets for just nine runs.
Australia comfortably won the match in the fifteenth over. Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden shared an opening partnership of 78 runs before Gilchrist was caught by Andrew Flintoff. Ricky Ponting was caught and bowled by Flintoff for 20 runs, but Hayden scored 67 not out as Australia cruised to an eight wicket victory.
Both England and Australia will advance to the Super 8 stage of the tournament. All three teams in the group have two points with one win and one defeat each, but Australia and England progress as Zimbabwe have an inferior net run rate.
