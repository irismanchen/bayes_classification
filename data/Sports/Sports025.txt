2007 Cricket World Cup - 1st Semi-Final: Sri Lanka vs New Zealand

Tuesday, April 24, 2007Â 
Sri Lanka have progressed to the final of the 2007 Cricket World Cup. They posted 289-5 in their 50 overs against New Zealand in the first semi-final at Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica. Captain Mahela Jayawardene made his maiden century of the World Cup, making 115*, whilst Upul Tharanga reached 73 before being bowled by Vettori.
In response, New Zealand struggled to 32/2, losing captain Stephen Fleming for just 1 and Ross Taylor soon after for 9. Scott Styris and Peter Fulton began rebuilding - their 50 partnership coming up in just 52 balls - including one over where they hit 20 off of some wayward bowling by Dilhara Fernando. But Styris fell 2 overs later to Tillakaratne Dilshan, followed by a New Zealand middle order collapse: going from 105/3 from 22 overs to 116/7 from 26. Craig McMillan hit a quick-fire 25, but just one ball after hitting a huge maximum he missed the ball, resulting in him being bowled out by Sanath Jayasuriya. Bond fell soon after for Muralitharan's 4th wicket, leaving New Zealand on the brink of being eliminated from the competition. Franklin and Patel rebuilt and reached their 50 partnership in just 55 balls - which is a new record for a 10th wicket partnership for this World Cup - but Patel succumbed to trying to slog Dilshan over midwicket, but falling short and being caught by Fernando to finish New Zealand's resistance. Sri Lanka won in comfortable fashion by a margin of 81 runs.
