Casey Stoner, Australia's new MotoGP world champion, won the Australian Grand Prix on Phillip Island, Victoria, in the afternoon of October 14.
Stoner, 21, started the race in third position behind Dani Pedrosa and five-time world champion Valentino Rossi, but picked up speed quickly and regained first position, finishing the race in 41 minutes, 12.244 seconds.
"It's unbelievable to win in front of my home crowd," Stoner said. "I didn't think the season could get any better but it just has. I really wanted to win this one and it just puts the icing on the cake."
The win at the Prix in front of more than 50,000 fans was Stoner's ninth victory, after claiming the world title last month in Japan.
