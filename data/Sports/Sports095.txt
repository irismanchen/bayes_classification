2007 Rugby World Cup: France 25 - 3 Ireland

Friday, September 21, 2007 
France have defeated Ireland 25-3 in Pool D of the 2007 Rugby World Cup at the Stade de France, Saint-Denis.
Jean-Baptiste Élissalde kicked three penalties to give France a nine point lead. Ronan O'Gara scored Ireland's only points of the match with a drop goal in the 37th minute. However Élissalde scored another penalty on the stroke of half time to bring the lead to 12-3.
Ireland looked unlikely to reduce the lead, and France wrapped up the victory with another penalty from Élissalde and two Vincent Clerc tries.
France lead Pool D with ten points, while Ireland are third on points difference behind Argentina, both with nine points. Georgia and Namibia complete Pool D with one point and no points respectively. Ireland must convincingly beat Argentina on September 30 to have a chance of qualifying for the quarter finals.
