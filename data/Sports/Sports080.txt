Saturday, September 29, 2007Â 
DC United took magic number to clinch MLS Supporters' Shield was reduced to 12 after a 4-1 come-from-behind victory against Toronto FC. After the loss, Toronto FC will be eliminated from post-season contention if Chicago Fire win against Chivas USA tonight.
Toronto for the second straight week took an early lead in the first half from a Carl Robinson free kick while DC United looked "passive" in the first half.
In the second half, DC United showed why they're the top team in the league by scoring four goals. Late in the half DC United went down to ten men when Fred went down with an injury after DC United's third and final substitution. The loss for Toronto FC makes it a 11 game winless streak. Toronto have now only scored two goals in their last 1,002 minutes played.
