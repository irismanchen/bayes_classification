AUCKLAND –This event saw an emergence of the Pacific Island nations into the Commonwealth Judo community. For many years only Fiji's Nacanieli Takayawa was apparent on the international scene. Although not taking many medals, the efforts going into development in nations such as Tonga allowed many of their players to place 5th or 7th. India also performed well, especially their women's team.
