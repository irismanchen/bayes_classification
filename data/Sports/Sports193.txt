With twenty-two laps left, Kurt Busch and Jeff Burton began to collide with each other, causing a chain reaction accident that included nineteen cars, the largest since the 2005 Aaron's 499 crash. No serious injuries were reported. Harvick said, "This has been a great place for us, I wanted to be behind (Clint Bowyer) because it was working pretty good for us. I want some of that pavement from the start/finish line." Kasey Kahne finished in the second position, ahead of Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. in third and fourth, respectively. Jeff Burton finished fifth, after his collision with Kurt Busch. Carl Edwards, Kurt Busch, Reed Sorenson, Mike Bliss, and Scott Speed rounded out the top ten positions. The race had a total of nine cautions and forty-seven lead changes among eighteen different drivers.
In the point standings, Harvick remained in first position, as Johnson's vacated second position was filled by Jeff Gordon after finishing the race in the thirty-first position. Kurt Busch climbed two positions into third, while Denny Hamlin fell to fifth position. Kyle Busch, Matt Kenseth, and Burton followed in the top eight points positions. Stewart maintained the ninth position, as Greg Biffle remained in tenth. Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Edwards rounded out the top twelve, and are currently in the Chase.
