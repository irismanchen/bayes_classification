England's only chance at goal came in the fourteenth minute when Mike Catt missed a drop goal attempt.
JP Pietersen scored a try for South Africa just before the end of the first half bringing the score to 20-0, and added a second try in the 64th minute. Percy Montgomery kicked 18 points to wrap up South Africa's victory.
South Africa lead Pool A with nine points. England are third on points difference behind Tonga, and must win a difficult match against Samoa next week to be able to advance to the knockout stages.
