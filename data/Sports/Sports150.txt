2007/08 UEFA Champions League: Manchester United vs. Barcelona

Tuesday, April 29, 2008Â 
Former England midfielder Paul Scholes scored the only goal of the match in the 14th minute with a swerving strike from 25 meters after collecting a loose ball that resulted from a Gianluca Zambrotta clearance error. Scholes and team captain, former Wales international Ryan Giggs are the last remaining players from the Manchester United side that beat FC Bayern Munich in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, played in Barcelona's own Camp Nou stadium.
Manchester United's defensive resiliency continued from last Wednesday's 1st leg and withstood Barcelona's attack as Lionel Messi and company failed to unsettle United's back line, despite a 4-3-3 formation spearheaded by Eto'o, Messi, and Iniesta's persistent pressure in the attacking third of the pitch. Barcelona managed to put several shots near the home goal, but never really tested Dutch international goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar.
The win for Manchester United guarantees the first all-English final in European Champion League and Champions Club Cup history when they face Chelsea in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium on May 21.
