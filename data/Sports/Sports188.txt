Hoping to reach the final tournament for the 1st time in 24 years, Asian champions Iraq defeated Pakistan 7-0 in the 1st leg of the 1st round of the Asian qualifying zone for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
Nashat Akram opened the scoring in 19th minute before Karim netted his 1st of four goals six minutes later. Iraq would go onto score five goals into the 2nd half.
The win was the first for new coach Egil Olsen. He took Norway to the 1994 and 1998 FIFA World CUP final and to 2nd place in the FIFA/Coca-Cola world ranking.
Iraq will play their 1st round home leg in Aleppo, Syria due to security concerns in Iraq.
