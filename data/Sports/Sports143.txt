It was Joe Ledley who opened the game up early with his well aimed volley. Cardiff pressurized the Barnsley goal early, and just as Robert Kozluk cleared the ball away with his head, Ledley connected with his left foot to float the ball over Luke Steele and give Cardiff the lead. The goal lit a fire under Barnsley and Stephen Foster could have equalized within minutes, but his header flew just wide. The game was played end to end for much of the first half, with Cardiff providing more of the games cutting edge.
In the second half the game continued to be played open. Ledley had a strong run down the sidelines for Cardiff, but Rae's header from the resulting cross was sent directly into Steele's arms. Kayode Odejayi then missed a glorious chance for Barnsley to draw level in the 66th minute. The Nigerian striker found himself one-on-one with Cardiff keeper Peter Enckelman, but Odejayi's shot went wide, rippling the side netting. Barnsley continued to push for the equalizer, but couldn't find the quality they had to take out Chelsea and Liverpool in previous rounds.
The appearance in the final is Cardiff's first since 1927 when they defeated Arsenal 1-0 and brought the FA Cup to Wales. The Bluebirds will look to take the trophy out of England for only the second time in history through 127 finals. Portsmouth and Cardiff will face off in the final on May 17th at Wembley.
