2008 Tour de Taiwan Stage 4: Intensive circulation at Taichung City

Thursday, March 13, 2008 
The Taichung City Stage of Tour de Taiwan 2008, approved by several executives since the first time set up in the Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium last year, raced today around the Wen-shin Forest Park near Shiang-shang Road, Wen-shin Road, Da-duen 7th Street, and He-nan Road Sec. 4.
It's a short-term circulation, however. But due to a few differences on land ranges, not every cyclist can keep the leading in a long-period. Finally, the "main group" with 90 participated cyclists passed the finish line, but Krzysztof Jeżowski from Merida Europe narrowly touched the finish line first to win the stage champion.
After the race, Wikinews Reporter Rico Shen briefly questioned Jeżowski about next 4 stages in Tour de Taiwan, he commented that he and his teammate will do several attempts to win the stage champions in next 4 stages to repay on anticipations by some cycling fans.
