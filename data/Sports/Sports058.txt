Bayern Munich beat Werder Bremen in Düsseldorf to advance to the League Cup Semi Finals against Stuttgart.
After an early Werder goal from Tim Borowski, the Bavarian club left their mark in the 2nd part of the 1st half with 3 goals from Schweinsteiger, Altıntop and Ribéry. Ribéry converted a penalty for his 2nd goal of the game. At this point, the pace of the game settled down and Andreas Ottl, Sandro Wagner and Christian Lell came on as substitutes.
With 3 Bayern strikers absent due to injury, Head Coach Ottmar Hitzfeld decided to go with 5 midfielders. The formation was 4-3-2-1 'Christmas Tree' shape with Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mark van Bommel behind Striker Miroslav Klose.
