2007 Rugby World Cup: New Zealand, Australia and England open with wins

Saturday, September 8, 2007 
New Zealand, Australia and England started their 2007 Rugby World Cup campaigns today with victories over Italy, Japan and the United States respectively. Australia and tournament favorites New Zealand comprehensively defeated their opposition, while defending champions England produced a comparatively unimpressive display to overcome the American team.
Tournament favourites New Zealand dominated their opening match against Italy. Richie McCaw opened the scoring after just 64 seconds and scored again in the seventh minutes. Tries from Doug Howlett, Mils Muliaina and two from Sitiveni Sivivatu increased the All Black's imposing lead. Just before half time, Marko Stanojevic scored a try for Italy taking the score to 43-7.
After the interval New Zealand scored five more tries, two each from Howlett and Jerry Collins and one from Chris Jack, with All Blacks fly half Daniel Carter kicking seventeen points during the match. In the 71st minute, Mirco Bergamasco scored a consolation try for Italy.
Japan's only points came from a Kōsei Ono penalty just before half time, while Stirling Mortlock kicked 27 points for Australia.
