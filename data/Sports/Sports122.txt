Bangladesh have beaten West Indies by six wickets in Group A of the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship at Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, South Africa.
The defeat eliminates West Indies from the tournament after their defeat to South Africa earlier in the week, while Bangladesh and South Africa will progress to the Super 8 stage.
The Bangladeshi bowlers stopped West Indies from making a big score and restricted them to only 164 runs from their 20 overs. Chris Gayle, who made a century in the match against South Africa, fell for a duck in the first over. Shakib Al Hasan took 4-34, while Syed Rasel took one wicket for just ten runs, including the valuable wicket of Chris Gayle, to restrict the West Indies. Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Devon Smith steadied the ship with a 95 run partnership. Devon Smith scored 51, while Dwayne Smith hit 29 runs off 7 balls as West Indies recovered to 164-8.
Bangladesh lost opening batsman Nazimuddin in the second over for just one run, followed by Tamim Iqbal for 10 soon afterwards. However Mohammad Ashraful and Aftab Ahmed shared a 109 run partnership as Ashraful scored the fastest half century in international Twenty20, smashing 61 runs off 27 balls.
