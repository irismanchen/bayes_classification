2007/08 Bundesliga: Nürnberg vs. Bayern Munich

Saturday, March 29, 2008 
Substitute Lukas Podolski scored a late equalizer to claim his 1st goal of the Bundesliga season against Nürnberg. This was Lukas Podolski's first-ever goal as a substitute in the Bundesliga
Bayern Munich coach Ottmar Hitzfeld made 3 changes to the side which beat Leverkusen last weekend, all of them enforced. Daniel van Buyten replaced Martin Demichelis, Andreas Ottl replaced Mark van Bommel, who was serving a suspension, and Christian Lell replaced Hamit Altintop who is out injured with fractured metatarsus. Hitzfeld experimented with preferring Philipp Lahm in an unfamiliar wide midfield role rather than the other option of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
