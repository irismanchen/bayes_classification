UEFA Cup 2007–08: Nürnberg vs. Everton

Thursday, November 8, 2007 
The first chance for the visiting team came just over 20 seconds into the match when Mikel Arteta saw his shot saved by Nürnberg goalkeeper Jaromír Blažek, before Tim Cahill's followup shot was tipped onto the goalposts. Nürnberg had chances from Peer Kluge and Dominik Reinhardt, but Kluge's attempt went just wide of the posts while Tim Howard saved Reinhardt's shot.
Everton opened the scoring late in the match when Berti Gláuber brought down Victor Anichebe, giving the visitors a penalty which Arteta converted. Five minutes later Anichebe scored to extend Everton's lead.
In the other Group A match of the evening, Zenit Saint Petersburg defeated Larissa 3-2. Everton lead Group A with two wins from two matches and look likely to qualify for the knockout stage. Saint Petersburg are second with four points while Dutch side AZ Alkmaar have one point with a game in hand. Nürnberg, defeated in their only match so far, are fourth in the group and Larissa are bottom with two defeats from two matches.
