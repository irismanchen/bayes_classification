Sunday, November 30, 2014 
Thursday's cricket Test match between Australia and India at the Gabba in Brisbane has been postponed to accommodate players attending the funeral of batsman Phillip Hughes on Wednesday.
"These are extraordinary circumstances and we simply couldn't or wouldn't expect our players to be emotionally ready to start a Test match the day after farewelling one of their team-mates," said Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland.
A new date for the match has not been settled on. It could be held between the Adelaide (December 12–16) and Boxing Day (December 26–30) Tests. An announcement is expected "in the next few days".
"After consulting with the players, we have communicated to Cricket Australia that the opportunity to farewell their team mate is the priority, and the prospect of them playing the following day is simply too big an ask," Australian Cricketers' Association chief executive Alistair Nicholson said. "The players are going through a grieving process and they must be afforded the opportunity to do so."
Fans who have purchased tickets to this match have been advised to hold onto their tickets.
