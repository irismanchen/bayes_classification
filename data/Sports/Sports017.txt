2006 Algarve Cup Preparations

Sunday, February 19, 2006Â 
Teams are preparing for the 2006 Algarve Cup international soccer tournament, March 9, 11, 13 and 15. The annual women's invitational, held in the Algarve region of Portugal, features some of the world's top teams and may foreshadow face-offs in the 2007 Women's World Cup. The United States women's national soccer team, champions in four of the last six Algarve Cups and second ranked in the world, will join the number one ranked Germany at this year's competition. The three "groups" of four teams who will play each other at the beginning of the tournament have yet to be finalized. However, it's been reported that the U.S. will be in a group with France, Denmark and China. The U.S. recently beaten China and tied France to win the 2006 Four Nations Tournament.
Teams with the luxury of being full-time players (some women professional athletes must keep regular jobs) will take a break from training before they begin arriving in Algarve next week.
