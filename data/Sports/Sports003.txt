The karate event distinguishes classes with different weights, men's are under 65kg, under 75kg, and over 75kg; women's just differed with classes at 60kg.
Juan Matias Diaz from Argentina shone in the battlefield with a 3rd-straight-win, to win his gold medal in Men's under 65kg class; but in Men's under 65kg class, Russian athlete Evgeniy Pavlyuchenko had to give up, and Takahiro Kojima won his gold medal by defeating his teammate Akinobe Miyashita.
