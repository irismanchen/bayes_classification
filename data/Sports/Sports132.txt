2007/08 Bundesliga: Bayern Munich vs. Hertha BSC Berlin

Saturday, May 17, 2008 
Bayern Munich set a new record for fewest goals conceded as Luca Toni finished as Bundesliga top scorer on the final day of the season in a 4-1 victory against Hertha BSC Berlin.
A series of farewells before kick-off brought the crowd to their feet in a string of standing ovations as Oliver Kahn, Bernd Dreher and Sepp Maier retired, Head Coach Ottmar Hitzfeld left to coach Switzerland and Jan Schlaudraff left for Hannover 96. Also leaving the club is Assistant Coach Michael Hanke. There was also a presentation for the match official, as referee Markus Merk also was on the Bundesliga stage for the last time before retirement.
Luca Toni's 2 goals in the 1st Half and a Franck Ribery goal put the reigning champions 3-0 up at half-time, before Luca Toni completed his hat-trick in the 2nd Half. Substitute Valeri Domovchiyski scored the only goal for Hertha BSC Berlin.
Ottmar Hitzfeld's final Bayern Munich team selection showed four changes to the side which beat Duisburg last week, with Philipp Lahm, Zé Roberto, Franck Ribéry and Luca Toni starting in place of Andreas Ottl, Jorse Ernesto Sosa, Jan Schlaudraff and Willy Sagnol.
Luca Toni's 3 goals took him to 24 for the Bundesliga season and the "cannon-shaped trophy" awarded to the league's leading scorer, while Bayern finished with just 21 goals against in 34 matches to beat Werder Bremen's previous record of 22 from 1987-88.
