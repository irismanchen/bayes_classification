Friday, March 14, 2008Â 
The 6th Stage of 2008 Tour de Taiwan held its long-distance race through 9 townships including Banciao, Hsinchuang, Wugu, Bali, Tamshui, Jinshan, Sanjhih, Shihmen, and Wanli in Taipei County today. Even though this race is the second longest race in 2008 Tour de Taiwan, the weather challenged 89 cyclists due to an earlier rain in Taipei-Keelung metropolitan area.
Even though some cyclists were unable to finish this race due to some crashes, but several participated cyclists still successfully finished this race steadily and safely. Finally, Kyle Gritters from Health Net Pro Cycling Team won the Champion of this stage. Shawn Milne and Peter McDonald still threatened the current sprint and overall leader John Murphy within a difference less than 10 seconds.
