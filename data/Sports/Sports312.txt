Yesterday at Estadio Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid, Real Madrid lost 1–0 to crosstown rival Atlético de Madrid in this year's edition of the Madrid derby. Atlético de Madrid had last defeated Real Madrid in La Liga play in 1999.
Diego Costa scored the game's only goal, following an early ten minutes where Real Madrid dominated on possession. Following the goal, Real Madrid was unable to keep up possession and Atlético successfully shut down much of Real Madrid's passing game. Atlético players also slowed down the play with a number of players falling to the ground. Real Madrid's fans shouted that miracles were happening because after Atlético players rolled around on the ground, they would get up and be able to walk and run within seconds.
