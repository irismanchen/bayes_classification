2011 Cricket World Cup: India vs Bangladesh

Monday, February 21, 2011Â 
India won the first match of the 2011 Cricket World Cup against Bangladesh by 87 runs on February 19. The Group B match was played at the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur, Bangladesh.
Bangladesh won the toss and chose to bowl first. In the Indian innings, Virender Sehwag scored the highest total, 175 runs off 140 balls, his highest one-day international score and Virat Kolhi played his debut World Cup match and scored a century, while remaining unbeaten on 100.
The first referral of the World Cup came after the 4th ball of the 2nd innings was bowled. India's Shanthakumaran Sreesanth had bowled a yorker and the umpire declared it not out. Dhoni referred it to the TV umpire and a replay showed it might have missed the leg stump, so the original decision was upheld. The match marked the debut of the controversial umpire referral system in World Cup cricket.
