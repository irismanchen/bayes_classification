2007/08 UEFA Cup: Fiorentina vs. Rangers F.C.

Friday, May 2, 2008Â 
After 210 minutes of goalless football between Italians Fiorentina and Scottish club Rangers, a penalty shootout decided who would progress to the 2007-08 UEFA Cup Final. In a match that contained thirteen shots on goal, neither team could find the back of the net, and so to penalties it went.
Barry Ferguson missed the opening spot-kick, seeing it saved by Sebastien Frey. Zdravko Kuzmanovic put the home side ahead. Steven Whittaker succeeded where his captain could not, slotting the ball home. Riccardo Montolivo maintained Fiorentina's lead before Sasa Papac put away Rangers' second. Fabio Liverani was next up, and his effort was saved by Neil Alexander. The shootout was now level, with one miss apiece.
Brahim Hemdani scored a third for Rangers, and then returned to the centre circle to witness Christian Vieri miss Fiorentina's second successive effort. It was left to Spaniard Nacho Novo to give Rangers victory, and he put his strike into the back of the net.
Rangers, who were reduced to ten men with ten minutes of extra time remaining after Daniel Cousin was sent off for an apparent headbutt on Fabio Liverani, will meet Zenit Saint Petersburg in the final in Manchester, England, on May 14, 2008. Zenit are managed by former Rangers boss Dick Advocaat.
