2008 Tour de Taiwan Stage 3: Varied changes at Changhua Stage

Tuesday, March 11, 2008Â 
The 3rd Stage of 2008 Tour de Taiwan was held today in Changhua County - the long-distance circulation. This race started at Baguashan, along County Route 19 through two townships including Tienwei and Yuanlin, and finally entered the climbing stage near the Arch of Baguashan. The route challenged cyclists' speed in the climbing stage, and many consider the Changhua County part of the race, the hardest of the tournament.

In this race, Tomoya Kano and Shinichi Fukushima sprinted for the leading advantage with four other cyclists, but after entering the downtown route, Angus Morton suddenly crashed when downgrading. This sudden crash reduced the differences within the six cyclists leading the group before the climbing stage. Finally, Peter McDonald from Drapac Porsche Development Program Team accidentally won the stage champion with his teammates' help.
With the advantages of steady weather and the climbing stage, Giant Asia Racing Team group took the lead, and Kuan-hua Lai from Giant Asia led in Taiwan Group during this stage. John Murphy from Health Net Pro Cycling Team still retained the liead in overall and sprint classes.
The Tour de Taiwan is a professional road bicycle racing event on the UCI Asia Tour. The event was established by Giant Sport Foundation founder King Liu in 1978. Last year's winner was Shawn Milne representing the United States.
