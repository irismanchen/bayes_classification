2007 Twenty20 World Championship: India vs Scotland

Thursday, September 13, 2007Â 
The match between India and Scotland in Group D of the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship at Kingsmead, Durban, South Africa has been abandoned due to rain.
Due to start at 18:00 (UTC+2), persistent rain at Kingsmead led to the start of the match being delayed.
At times the rain eased off, allowing the toss to be taken, which resulted in Scotland choosing to field first and the possibility of starting the match.
However the rain continued to fall and the prospects of play starting became more remote. As the latest point a match could have started was 21:00, including a reduction of overs, the match was abandoned at 20:35 (UTC+2) as there would not have been enough time for the groundsmen to prepare the pitch and outfield for a 21:00 start.
India and Scotland share one point each from the no result. India are ahead of Scotland in Group D on net run rate, meaning that India must avoid a heavy defeat by Pakistan tomorrow in order to progress to the Super 8 stage. Pakistan are now guaranteed a place in the next round.
India: A B Agarkar, M S Dhoni (capt, wkt), G Gambhir, Harbhajan Singh, K D Karthik, I K Pathan, V Sehwag, R P Singh, S Sreesanth, R V Uthappa, Yuvraj Singh
Scotland: J A R Blain, D R Brown, G M Hamilton, R M Haq, N F I McCallum, J D Nel, N S Poonia, C J O Smith (wkt), R R Watson (capt), D F Watts, C M Wright
