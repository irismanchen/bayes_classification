Bayern Munich took the lead in an evenly matched first period as Francy Ribéry scored on a penalty after Luca Toni was fouled by Petri Pasanen in the 31st minute. Bayern’s second goal came early in the 2nd half as Luca Toni scored his 2nd goal in as many games in the 51st minute. Bayern finished the match off when substitutes Hamit Altintop and Andreas Ottl in the 79th and 87th minute respectively.
