2007 Cricket World Cup: West Indies vs Bangladesh

Thursday, April 19, 2007Â 
West Indies have beaten Bangladesh by 99 runs in the Super 8 stage of the World Cup at the Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados. Both teams had already failed to qualify for the semi-final stage of the tournament before today's match. Bangladesh's World Cup is now over, while West Indies have one match remaining against England on April 21.
West Indies stumbled to 55/3 after a slow start, losing Gayle and Smith cheaply with Shivnarine Chanderpaul scoring 50 off 85 balls. They had only reached 67-3 at the half-way point of their innings, restricted by some tight bowling from seamers Mashrafe Mortaza and Syed Rasel. However Ramnaresh Sarwan (91 not out), Brian Lara (33) and Marlon Samuels (31) salvaged a respectable total of 230 for the hosts. 230 is the lowest score that a opening batting team has won with in this world cup(Zimbabwe-Ireland had a tie at 221), previous low was 235 for Sri Lanka against England.
Bangladesh found scoring against West Indies' pace bowling attack difficult and were bowled out for just 131 after 43.5 overs. Daren Powell was the pick of the bowlers, taking 3/38 off 10 overs, while Corey Collymore took 2/11 and both Dwayne Bravo and Chris Gayle finished with 2/28.
