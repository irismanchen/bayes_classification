2008 Leisure Taiwan launched in Taipei World Trade Center

Saturday, July 19, 2008Â 

This year's Leisure Taiwan trade show (a.k.a Taiwan Sport Recreation and Leisure Show) started yesterday, with 131 companies participating including sports media companies such as ESPN and VideoLand Television, businesses selling sports equipment and fitness clubs.
There were also a variety of sports being played in the arena built for the trade show. The events included a 3-on-3 basketball tournament, free style shooting, and bicycle test-riding. In addition, conferences discussed issues related to sports and physical education.
A major topic in the trade show was energy-efficiency and, as a result, bicycles and similar sports equipment were being heavily promoted.
Next Tuesday, companies from the electronics industry plan to promote their industry at "2008 Digital E-Park." In previous years, organizations from the electronics industry have showcased their products at Leisure Taiwan instead of at the Digital E-Park, so this move has reduced the number of markets covered by Leisure Taiwan.
