London, England— When four competitors from Côte d'Ivoire enter London's Olympic Stadium for this year's Summer Paralympics Opening Ceremony, they will be the fifth group of competitors representing their country at the Games.
Côte d'Ivoire is fielding four competitors in-all; Addoh Kimou and Kouame Jean-luc Noumbo are to represent their country in athletics, Kimou competing in the men's T46 200 and 400 metre events, Noumbo in the men's T46 100 and 200 metres. Powerlifters Alidou Diamoutene and Carine Cynthia Amandine Tchei round out the country's delegation, with Diamoutene competing in the men's 52kg event and Tchei in the women's 67.50 kg event.
Whilst Côte d'Ivoire previously won four Paralympic medals—three golds and one bronze, all in athletics—they have not finished in a medal spot since the 2000 Paralympics when Oumar Basakoulba Kone won his third gold medal in the 800 metres; fellow countryman Fernand Kra Koffi took the bronze in the same event.
