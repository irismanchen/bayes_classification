Germany have opened their 2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup campaign with a draw against Colombia in Cheonan, South Korea.
The opening goal of the match came in 14th minute when Colombia captain Miguel Julio met a free kick with a header. The Germans began creating chances before Dennis Dowidat netted a 34th minute equaliser, accelerating past his marker down the right and arrowing a drive into the far top corner from a tight angle. The Europeans took the lead just five minutes later after a passing move down the right flank, Richard Sukuta-Pasu converting a low cross to hand his side a 2-1 half time lead.
The Germans got their 3rd goal of the game with a similar move just after half time. Toni Kroos supplied a cross for Dowidat to poke him his second of the game during the 49th minute. Colombia tied the game with a penalty shot and a long range goal from Cristian Nazarith in the 66th minute and 88th minute respectively.
