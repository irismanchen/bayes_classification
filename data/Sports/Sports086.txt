Argentina reached their first ever World Cup semi-final with a 19-13 victory over Scotland in the quarter-final stage of the 2007 Rugby World Cup at the Stade de France, Saint-Denis, France.
Scotland took the lead with a penalty from Dan Parks. However Felipe Contepomi kicked two penalties as Argentina moved ahead, before Gonzalo Longo Elía added a try to extend their lead. Chris Paterson responded with a penalty just before half time, but Argentina went into the interval leading 13-6.
Argentina extended their lead further after the break with a third penalty from Felipe Contepomi and a drop goal frim Juan Martín Hernández. Chris Cusiter scored a try for Scotland with seventeen minutes remaining, but they could not make a breakthrough as Argentina held on to win.
