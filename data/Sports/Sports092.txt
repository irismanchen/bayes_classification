In Pool A of the 2007 Rugby World Cup, defending champions England secured qualification for the quarter final stage of the tournament with a 36-20 victory over Tonga at Parc des Princes, Paris, France.
Pierre Hola scored a penalty to give Tonga an early 3-0 lead, but Jonny Wilkinson equalised soon afterwards. Sukanaivalu Hufanga restored Tonga's lead with a 17th minute try. At the interval England led 19-10 after Paul Sackey scored two tries and Jonny Wilkinson added another penalty and a drop goal.
Tries from Mathew Tait and Andy Farrell and another Johnny Wilkinson drop goal completed a comfortable win for England, while Hale T Pole scored a late consolation try for Tonga.
England finish second in the pool with fourteen points, behind South Africa who top the group with one game left to play. Tonga are eliminated from the tournament but qualify automatically for the 2011 World Cup by finishing third in the group. England will play Australia in the quarter finals in a repeat of the 2003 final.
