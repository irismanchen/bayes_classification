Bayern Munich won their 6th League Cup with a goal from Miroslav Klose on a defensive mix-up in Leipzig.
Hamit Altintop hit the crossbar with 20 minutes left. The game picked up pace in the second half, but Bayern Munich controlled the match to collect the trophy and the €2 million prize money.
With Mark van Bommel out through suspension and Franck Ribery and Bastian Schweinsteiger out due to injury, starting 11 showed six changes to the side which defeated Stuttgart in Wednesday’s semi-final.
