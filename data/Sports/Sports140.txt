2007/08 Bundesliga: Wolfsburg vs. Hansa Rostock

Saturday, October 6, 2007 
Wolfsburg Coach Felix Magath made a solitary change to his team which took an away point off Hamburg. Schäfer took the place of Quiroga at left back. The Hansa Rostock coach Frank Pagelsdorf saw no reason to change his team which took nine points from their last three games. Their last victory was against the defending champions Stuttgart.
The game began in a cautious manner, with Hansa Rostock defending in their own half, hoping to hit Wolfsburg on a counter attack. Wolfsburg tried to take the game to visitors from the former DDR, but they didn't create any goalscoring chances during the opening minutes.
When a 0-0 draw looked inevitable, Wolfsburg secured all three points in the 89th minute.
After the Bundesliga break, Wolfsburg will travel to and play Hannover in the Niedersachsen derby.
