Yesterday, 1964 Summer Paralympic swimmer Trevor French died. News of his death was shared with Wikinews through the Australian Tax Office and Tony Naar of the Australian Paralympic Committee.
French, who lived in Penrith, New South Wales, was one of fifteen athletes to compete at Australia's second Paralympic Games in 1964 in Tokyo when he won a silver medal in the men's 25 metre freestyle event. It was the only medal he earned at the Games and one of 30 Australia earned that year. In 2000, his medal was displayed at the Our Sporting Heritage exhibition at the Arms of Australia Inn Museum.
His legacy of participation can be seen in the upcoming 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. Australia are sending 161 athletes to the Paralympics this year. The Paralympic team is expected to finish the Games having earned the country's one thousandth medal.
