2007/08 Bundesliga: Stuttgart vs. Hannover

Saturday, October 6, 2007Â 
Stuttgart suffered another setback in their defence of their championship after losing to Hannover 2-0 at home. Two goals from Szabolcs Huszti secured Hannover a 2-0 win against Stuttgart, who were reduced to 10 men in the 7th minute. Fernando Meira was sent off for deliberate handball in the penalty area and Huszti powered home the spot-kick.
Stuttgart struggled to recover from the red card and failed to create a chance until the 28th minute when Mario Gomez headed a corner straight at Hannover goalkeeper Robert Enke.
Hannover would have been two up after 36 minutes had Raphael Schafer not been alert. Schafer rushed out to get the ball at the feet of Hanno Balitsch.
Steve Cherundolo crossed and Huszti was well positioned to score his second goal of the game.
Defeat leaves Stuttgart in 12th place, 10 points behind leaders Bayern Munich who play tomorrow. Hannover, meanwhile, climbed into the top 6 with the victory.
