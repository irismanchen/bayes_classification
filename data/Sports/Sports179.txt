Since the 2008 Tour de Taiwan entered the Taipei-Keelung metropolitan area for a golden-72-hours' final battle, the Taipei World Trade Center Nangang Exhibition Hall (TWTC Nangang) stage raced today from Jing-mao 2nd Road through Nangang Road and Sanchung Road to the TWTC Nangang. With its new setup in the Tour de Taiwan, the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) and Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of the China respected this stage honorarily.
Within 10 laps near the Sanchong Road and Nangang Road, Po-hung Wu, who crashed yesterday after the finish line, crashed again and was forced to quit the race. After some medical aid, he spoke to the Wikinews Reporter Rico Shen: "Even though I crashed frequently in my career...[I was] unable to prevent the crash because you will not know what will happen in [a second]. If possible, just to decrease the possibility of the crash when racing."
But before a brief interview to Po-hung Wu, another crash happened near the 30th lap, not only a Malaysian cyclist was forced to quit this race, but also the referee temporarily suspended and neutralized this race because several cyclists crashed near the finish line. After the officials and referees confirmed the safety of the race lane, this race was firmly reopened. Finally, Kam-po Wong, the 1st Stage Champion, a cyclist form Hong Kong Pro Cycling Team, won this stage champion and helped John Murphy keep his overall leading in this stage.
