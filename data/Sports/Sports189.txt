Colombia and Brazil opened their 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualification campaign with a 0-0 draw.
Despite inexperienced squad, Colombia had most of the chances and Brazil became less of a threat as the game went on.
The match started 45 minutes late after a torrential downpour left the pitch temporarily unplayable. But the water drained away quickly.
Colombia pressed forward after for the majority of the game. However, they couldn't take any of their chances and ended with a 0-0 scoreline.
Brazil could find themselves in trouble with an accumulation of yellow cards as 4 of their players picked up their 1st yellow cards.
