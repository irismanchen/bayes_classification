Monday, October 1, 2007 
In the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Argentina and France qualified for the knockout stage of the competition from Pool D at the expense of Ireland and Georgia. Elsewhere, South Africa, who have already secured a place in the quarter finals, defeated the United States in Pool A.
France eased to a 64-7 win over Georgia to finish second in Pool D. Clément Poitrenaud, Yannick Nyanga and Lionel Beauxis each scored tries as France led 30-0 at half time. After the interval Sébastien Bruno, Lionel Nallet and Rémy Martin scored tries while Christophe Dominici added two. Zviad Maisuradze scored a try to give Georgia their only points of the match. Julien Bonnaire scored a late try to wrap up the win for France, who face New Zealand in the quarter finals.
Ireland were eliminated from the pool stages for the first time as they fell 15-30 to Argentina. Lucas Borges was the first to score for Argentina before Ronan O'Gara scored a penalty for Ireland. Juan Martín Hernández kicked a drop goal soon afterwards as Argentina led 8-3. Ireland briefly took the lead when Brian O'Driscoll scored, but another drop goal from Hernández and a Horacio Agulla try meant that Argentina went into half time leading 18-10. Geordan Murphy scored a try for Ireland after the interval but Argentina were victorious after Felipe Contepomi kicked three penalties and Hernández scored his third drop goal of the match. Argentina will play Scotland in the quarter finals, while Ireland have automatically qualified for the 2011 World Cup by finishing third in Pool D.
Pool A winners South Africa comfortably defeated the United States 64-15. South Africa scored nine tries, with Bryan Habana and Jaque Fourie each scoring two. Takudzwa Ngwenya and Chris Wyles both added tries for the Americans. South Africa face Fiji in the quarter finals, while Australia and England complete the quarter finals lineup.
