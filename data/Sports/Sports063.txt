Pakistan have defeated Bangladesh by four wickets in the Super 8 stage of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 at Newlands Cricket Ground, Cape Town, South Africa.
Bangladesh were bowled out for 140 runs. Twenty20 international debutant Junaid Siddique was by far Bangladesh's top scorer with 71, earning him the Man of the Match award. However none of the other batsmen made more than fifteen as Shoaib Malik and Mohammad Hafeez took two wickets each for Pakistan.
Pakistan's Imran Nazir retired hurt in the first over. Shahid Afridi (39) and Mohammad Hafeez (23) shared a 59 run partnership in just under six overs. However Bangladesh's bowlers restricted Pakistan to 119-6 in the seventeenth over as Abdur Razzak took 2-16 from four overs and Shakib Al Hasan gave away just 17 runs from his four overs. However Imran Nazir was able to rejoin the batting and took Pakistan to victory with one over to spare.
