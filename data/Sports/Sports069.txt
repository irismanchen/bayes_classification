Sunday, September 16, 2007Â 
South Africa defeated England by 19 runs in the Super 8 stage of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 at Newlands Cricket Ground, Cape Town, South Africa.
After suffering an early blow, when opening batsman Jean-Paul Duminy was caught behind off Stuart Broad's first delivery, South Africa were restricted by the England bowlers. Two wickets fell quickly as Dimitri Mascarenhas caught Graeme Smith for 19 runs and Abraham de Villiers was caught behind for 18. After a partnership of 49 runs between Justin Kemp and Mark Boucher, South Africa lost three wickets in quick succession to reduce them to 94-6. However England missed some catches, and dropped Albie Morkel twice. Morkel went on to score 43 runs off 20 balls to take South Africa to 154-8 at the end of their twenty overs.
England opener Luke Wright fell in the first over for a duck, and Kevin Pietersen was run out after losing his bat in a collision with bowler Shaun Pollock. Paul Collingwood was caught first ball at slip, and England were left on 27-3. Matt Prior (32) and Owais Shah (36) shared a partnership of 55 runs, but England scored too slowly. After Andrew Flintoff was bowled by Johan van der Wath for 17 runs, England could only reach 135-7 after twenty overs.
