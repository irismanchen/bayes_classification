Thursday, September 13, 2007Â 
England have beaten Zimbabwe by 50 runs in Group B of the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship at Newlands Cricket Ground, Cape Town, South Africa.
After losing two batsmen in two balls followed by the dismissal of Matt Prior for 20 runs, England were left on 51-3. Kevin Pietersen and Paul Collingwood shared a partnership of 100 runs. Pietersen hit 79 runs off 37 balls, while Paul Collingwood was run out for 37. Elton Chigumbura took four wickets for Zimbabwe as England reached 188-9 after 20 overs.
Vusi Sibanda and Brendan Taylor got Zimbabwe off to a good reply, adding 74 runs. Brendan Taylor scored 47 runs before he was bowled by Dimitri Mascarenhas, while Tatenda Taibu was also bowled after scoring just two runs. Dimitri Mascarenhas took 3-18 and Chris Schofield took 2-15 to reduce Zimbabwe to 89-5. Zimbabwe did not recover and finished the twenty overs on 138-7, 50 runs short of England's total.
Group A depends on England's match against Australia tomorrow. England are top of the group with one victory, while Zimbabwe are second with one win and one loss. Australia need to beat England to avoid an early exit from the tournament.
