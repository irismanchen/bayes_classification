2007 Cricket World Cup: England vs West Indies

Saturday, April 21, 2007Â 
England have defeated the West Indies in the final game of the Super 8 phase of the World Cup at the Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados. The result decided little: England finished 5th in the Super 8s table, with the West Indies coming 6th.
The end of the match was tight with the result tipping in the balance for the last 5 overs. With just 3 overs left England needed 29 runs - looking unlikely to win the match, but Paul Nixon stepped up and hit 13 off the next over, with another 4 coming from extras, to turn the match round; giving England the upper hand. Despite being bowled out by Dwayne Bravo - who had earlier been involved in the dismissal of 4 other English batsmen (two from run outs, two from bowling and taking one catch) - tail enders Anderson and Broad gave England a tight 1 wicket win with just 1 ball remaining.
This was the last appearance for West Indies captain Brian Lara in international cricket: he has now retired from both Test and ODI cricket.
Toss: England won, and elected to field first.
