The designated TADA court pronounced accused no. 55 in the '93 Mumbai bombing case Sarfaraz Dawood Phanse guilty of conspiracy and transporting arms and ammunition used in the attacks. Five aides of prime accused Tiger Memon, Manzoor Querishi, Kasam Shaikh, Sultan-E-Rome, Abdul Aziz Shaikh and Mohammad Iqbal Shaikh, were acquitted of aiding and abetting terrorist activities.
According to the Central Bureau of Investigation, the five men had travelled to Dubai in the February of 1993 to attend a meeting where the blasts were planned, and had also planned to go to Pakistan for weapons training. They had earlier confessed to their involvement in the conspiracy but, subsequently, retracted their statements.
