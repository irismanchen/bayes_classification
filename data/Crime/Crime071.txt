Three blasts occurred in Mumbai Wednesday evening in one of the busiest areas of the city. It has been estimated that 21 people have been killed and up to 113 injured. According to a regional government official, Prithviraj Chavan, the explosions were "a co-ordinated attack by terrorists."
The first blast took place in South Mumbai's Zaveri Bazar at 1854 local time (1324 UTC), in which several were injured. Here, a motorcycle had a bomb attached to it that exploded next to a jewelry shop. According to eyewitnesses, fire broke out immediately after the blast.
The second explosion happened at the Opera House in Charni Road within a few minutes of the first one. This was the most powerful explosion, caused by a bomb that blew up inside a building.
The third one took place in Dadar at 1905 local time (1405 UTC), where a taxi was rigged for the purpose. All three of the locations are commercial and residential areas with busy streets and heavy traffic.
According to an eyewitness to the Zaveri Bazar explosion, "[b]odies and limbs were strewn everywhere. People were crying and screaming. The area was packed with shoppers at the time of the blast. A few offered assistance to the blood-soaked victims, while others looked on in a state of shock."
