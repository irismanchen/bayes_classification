A bombing in the Iraqi province of Diyala has killed 15 people, according to local officials. The suicide bomb exploded at the entrance to a local government centre in the city of Baquba, which is one of the most deadly areas in Iraq. 39 people were also wounded by the attack.
An anonymous witness of the blast described the bomber. "I heard some of the injured people saying they saw a woman wearing a black robe blow herself up."
This attack comes after a bombing on Tuesday killed 51 people, according to local police. That bomb exploded near a bus stop in the Hurriya area, which is mainly populated with Shia Muslims. 75 people were also wounded in Tuesday's attack, which was the deadliest in the area for three months.
