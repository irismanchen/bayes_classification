An arrest has been made in the almost 10-year-old murder of JonBenét Ramsey, according to a law enforcement official. The suspect is 41-year-old John Mark Karr, a former second grade teacher. Karr was detained in Bangkok, Thailand at the request of the U.S. government. The suspect faces charges in Colorado.
Local authorities in Boulder, Colorado, where the suspect will face a murder charge, declined to comment.
9News, a Denver television station, claimed that the suspect had confessed to elements of the crime that were not public.
CBS News is reporting that according to their sources the suspect is John Mark Karr, a 41-year-old American man and second-grade schoolteacher, who will be brought back to the United States this weekend.
JonBenét's father, John Ramsey, told 9News that he has been notified of the arrest. Asked if he knew Karr, Ramsey replied, "To the best of my knowledge, no," the station's Web site reported.
According to CBC, John Ramsey released the following statement to the media:
On December 26, 1996, 6-year-old JonBenét Ramsey, a child beauty pageant queen, was found murdered in the basement of her parents' home in Boulder, Colorado, United States, eight hours after being reported missing. The case drew national attention when no suspect was charged and suspicions turned to possible family involvement.
