At least ten attackers with knives, dressed in black, attacked a train station in Kunming, China yesterday. At least 28 victims were killed, with 113 more wounded by knives, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported. The local municipal government accuses "Xinjiang separatist forces" for the attack. Xinhua called the attack "an organized, premeditated violent terrorist attack". One suspect was arrested, while four or five suspects were shot dead.
Yang Haifei, a local resident, told Xinhua the attackers rushed in and began attacking people while he was buying a ticket. "I saw a person come straight at me with a long knife and I ran away with everyone," he said, while people who were slower were attacked and "fell on the ground".
Preparations are underway for an annual legislature meeting, at which president Xi Jinping as well as his government are to deliver their first one-year work report on Wednesday. Xi Jinping states there should be "all out efforts" to apprehend the attackers, while the Ministry of Public Security's Security Management Bureau stated law enforcement will "crack down the crimes in accordance with the law without any tolerance." He calls for severe punishments "in accordance with the law", as well as to "crack down on those who have been swollen with arrogance".
China has also blamed a suicide attack in Tiananmen Square late last year, in Beijing, on the separatists.
