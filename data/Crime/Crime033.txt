Tokyo, Japan — Eleven university hospitals in Tokyo have been threatened with bombings, within 45 days, unless they double admissions quotas to their medical schools for the next academic year. The University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital, and Keio University Hospital are among the threatened institutions.
Police said that the letters all appear to come from the same source but they have not released the actual letters yet. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department is investigating, but nothing suspicious has been found at the hospitals.
Security has increased ahead of an upcoming September 11 general election.
