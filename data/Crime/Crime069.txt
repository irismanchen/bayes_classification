Hamdi Issac, a suspect in the 21 July bombings in London, has been ordered by an Italian court to return to the UK.
The Ethiopian national was arrested in Rome a few days after the July 21 failed terror attacks in London.
Despite today's decision by Rome's appeal court, Issac's attorneys are expected to immediately appeal, delaying his extradition by up to a month.
