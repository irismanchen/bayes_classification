Another arrest in Minnesota school shooting

Monday, March 28, 2005Â 
News spread in the Red Lake community today as funerals for Jeff Weise and three of the nine victims were held that another student was arrested in connection with the school shootings of March 21. Authorities said little officially beyond confirming today's arrest. However, a source with knowledge of the investigation told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that it was Louis Jourdain, 16-year old son of Red Lake Tribal Chairman Floyd Jourdain. It is not known at this time what charges will be laid or what led authorities to the boy but juvenile proceedings have begun in federal court.
Last Tuesday, investigators had said that Weise had acted alone and his motives were unknown though he suffered from depression and expressed interest in Nazism.
