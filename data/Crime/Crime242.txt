Over 350 protesters, including anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, were arrested Monday near the White House. Sheehan was fined $75 for demonstrating without a permit.
The protestors demanded to speak with current US President George W. Bush. The demonstrators sat on the sidewalk illegally, after marching along the pedestrian walkway on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House. Police reportedly warned the demonstrators numerous times of the law, then began making arrests.
Sheehan has announced that she will not pay the fine, and is scheduled to appear in court on November 16.
