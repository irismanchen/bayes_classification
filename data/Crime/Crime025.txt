Sunday, May 7, 2006 
One person is dead and 13 others, including 5 members of the Garda Síochána, Ireland's police force, are injured following the pursuit of a stolen bus throughout the south of Dublin city and county.
A driver who was not authorised to take the vehicle early in the morning of May 7 stole the coach from the yard of private hire operator Dualway. The bus was later located at Dublin Heuston railway station by the coach company, where the driver attempted to run over the son of the owner of Dualway.
The driver then returned to the Dualway depot in Rathcoole in what developed in to a high speed pursuit involving up to 20 patrol cars and a police helicopter. The Gardaí fired several shots at the driver's tires in an attempt to stop the car, as well as laying tacks. The bus was driven down the wrong side of the N7 Naas road, where it collided with a number of cars, killing a female driver, and rammed five Garda patrol cars that were blocking the road. The driver was apprehended and arrested at the Dualway depot after crashing the bus.
Sections of the N7 as well as surrounding roads were closed following the incident for forensic examinations, and the Luas tram services were severely curtailed.
