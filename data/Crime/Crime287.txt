Tuesday, February 6, 2007Â 
NASA astronaut Lisa Nowak was arrested at Orlando International Airport on charges of attempted kidnapping, battery, attempted vehicle burglary with battery, and destruction of evidence. The latter charge was dismissed, but despite posting bail for the others her release was delayed after police announced they were filing an attempted murder charge against her. Nowak flew on STS-121 last July.
