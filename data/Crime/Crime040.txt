Buffalo, New York — The Buffalo Fire Department is currently investigating how 12 "fire bombs" ended up inside an abandoned apartment house on 15 Allen Street in Allentown, a neighborhood in Buffalo, New York on Wednesday November 7.
In an exclusive report, Wikinews has learned from a witness who wishes to remain anonymous, that at approximately 12:00 p.m. EST (UTC-5) Heidi Garner called 9-1-1 to report that while walking her dog, it had been attacked by two other dogs when it sniffed under a gate of the house. When police arrived to investigate and retrieve the assaulting dogs, they entered the house and found the 12 fire bombs. It is not known what the devices were made of or what the explosive material was, but unconfirmed reports say the main explosive source was gasoline.
The Hazmat team, the bomb squad, and emergency services were then dispatched to the scene to dispose of the devices, according to witness reports. It is not known where they were taken.
Both dogs were immediately put to sleep because they were fighting over the body of the dead dog. It is not known who is the owner of the dogs, as the house was not rented, and no one was supposed to be living there.
Wikinews has also learned, while investigating the property history, the Erie County's Department of Finance says that the building, which also has a storefront, is allegedly owned by a Richard White who happens to live next door at 17 Allen. White bought the property from Edward G. Koch in 1996. The building was built in 1910.
It is not known what the devices were going to be used for and an investigation is ongoing. It is not known if there are any suspects.
Because of a severe amount of garbage and dog feces, the City of Buffalo has condemned the building.
