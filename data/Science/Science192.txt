Australia's emergency telephone service, triple-0, which is operated by Telstra, has been lost in Southern New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory following damage to two optical fibre cables.
It is believed that in two separate incidents, optical fibre cables were cut at Gundagai and Narrandera in Southern NSW. In addition to the loss of the triple-0 service, 34 mobile base stations in the region have also been affected. According to Telstra, local calls are still possible, and they recommend that people dial their local fire, ambulance or police station in case of an emergency.
Telstra says that services will be restored as soon as possible.
