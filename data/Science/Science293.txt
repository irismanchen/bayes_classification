California based QLogic Corporation has announced that it is to establish its EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) headquarters in County Dublin, Ireland. The new centre will be based in a 20,000-square-foot facility in Blanchardstown. Up to 100 people will be employed there within five years time.
QLogic manufactures many important components that are used in servers, PC's and various networking products by companies such as Dell, Cisco, and HP.
The CEO of QLogic, Mr. H. K. Desai, said of the companies decision to locate in Ireland "We chose Dublin as we believe it will best service our long-term needs, enable us to recruit the calibre of people we require and facilitate the timely delivery of product to our customers overseas.”
Ireland has continued to attract large amounts of FDI in recent years despite the slowdown in the world economy in 2002. Recent additions to Ireland's list of multinationals include Amazon.com, eBay, Bell Labs and Yahoo.
