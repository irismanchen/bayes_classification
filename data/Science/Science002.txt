The paper "Guidelines for a space propulsion device based on Heim's quantum theory" by Walter Dröscher (Austrian patent officer; retired) and Jochem Häuser (University of Applied Sciences in Salzgitter, Germany; Physicist &amp; Professor of Computer Science) has won an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) annual award for the best papers presented at its conferences (nuclear and future flight category).
The paper proposes experiments aimed at using intense magnetic fields to produce a gravitational field, which then propels a space craft. The work is based upon ideas developed by Burkhard Heim in the 1950s. Heim's theories are not widely accepted in the physics community. They do, however, pass many experimental tests, such as accurately predicting masses of fundamental particles within current experimental limits.
Dröscher says Heim's theories predict two additional forces, one is a repulsive anti-gravity consistent with the dark energy that appears to be causing the universe's expansion to accelerate, and one capable of producing acceleration of a spacecraft without expending mass, i.e. rocket fuel. NASA has investigated possible anti-gravity applications of Heim's theories before, but Dröscher &amp; Häuser say their proposed experiments differ significantly.
The U.S. Air Force has expressed interest in the idea. Experiments are expected to proceed if the idea survives further scrutiny in the physics community.
